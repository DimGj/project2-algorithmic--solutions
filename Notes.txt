1)Import LSH
2)Figure Out how to start the graph connection process(Graph is directed,from which direction should i start)
3)Graph Construction : 
    i)Hash all Datapoints in buckets with LSH.
    ii)Iterate over all points after hash and assign k-points of corresponding bucket as neighbours to i-th item.
    iii)Delete points from bucket,since they wont be assigned to it.
    iv)Directed graph means only parent has access to children,
